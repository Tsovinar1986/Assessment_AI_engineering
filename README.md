My assessment meant to make UI and the core vector using supabase for creating rag model for running a chat which contains:
1. PDF loading part using it to see the chunks how many chunk are there and see what it can do
2. The chat part where we write to make these odf file up to 20000 word handbook for AI engineering or to reply by main only creation.
Using the API keys for OpenAI, Groq,supabase and it's url part.
For the interface used gradio for it to see but can be used streamlit as well.
First of all the hard part for me was making all it if be true it's my first time whole think making like for rag parts and the ui as in all the projects parts i have been making like model or analysis part for the data which have to be used but would like to learn while working and doing more more practices will make more good parts to do it.
